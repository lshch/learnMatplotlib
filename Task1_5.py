# Seaborn - Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn offers a wide range of functions for visualizing different types of data, including: Â 
#
# Distributions: Histograms, KDE plots, and rug plots for visualizing the distribution of a single variable.
# Relationships: Scatter plots, line plots, and joint plots for exploring relationships between two or more variables.
# Categorical data: Bar plots, count plots, and box plots for visualizing categorical data.
# Grids: Facet grids and pair plots for organizing multiple plots together.
# Heatmaps: Heatmaps for visualizing two-dimensional data.

# 5. Time Series Analysis of Reviews
# Plot: Create a line plot to show the trend of number_of_reviews over time
# (last_review) for each neighbourhood_group.
# Details: Use different colors for each neighborhood group, smooth the data with a
# rolling average, and add titles, axis labels, and a legend.

# Convert 'last_review' to a datetime format
df['last_review'] = pd.to_datetime(df['last_review'])



# Group the data by neighborhood group and last review month, then count the number of reviews
#grouped_data = df.groupby(['neighbourhood_group', pd.Grouper(key='last_review', freq='ME')])['number_of_reviews'].count().reset_index()

# Group data by neighborhood group and month, count reviews
grouped_data = df.groupby(['neighbourhood_group', df['last_review'].dt.to_period('M')])['number_of_reviews'].count().reset_index()



# Calculate a rolling average of the number of reviews using rolling(window=3)
rolling_avg = grouped_data.groupby('neighbourhood_group')['number_of_reviews'].rolling(window=3).mean()

    # Assuming the second level is the date (month), use this:

else:  # If there's only one level (or no level)
    # No level argument needed, reset the index directly
